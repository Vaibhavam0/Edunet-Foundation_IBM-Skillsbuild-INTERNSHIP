**Access to clean and safe drinking water remains a significant challenge in India, especially in rural and economically backward areas. According to the 78th Round of the Multiple Indicator Survey (MIS), around 27% of rural households still lack access to improved sources of drinking water. This project leverages IBM Watsonx Studio and Python-based data analysis to study and model these disparities using survey data from over 3,00,000 households across multiple states. We applied machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, achieving an accuracy of over 85% in predicting households at risk of lacking access to safe water. The study also analyzed related indicators such as the usage of clean cooking fuel (only 55% rural coverage) and migration trends, which showed a clear correlation with water scarcity. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, the project delivers actionable insights that can support evidence-based policymaking aligned with SDG Goal 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation. Future enhancements include integrating real-time water quality data, expanding coverage to more regions, and deploying the system using edge computing for on-ground analysis. This project is a step toward ensuring that clean water is not a privilege, but a right for every household in India**.
